<!-- In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
        !-- <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png" -->

<!-- Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element. -->

<!-- <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-2.png" -->

<!-- The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it. -->

<!-- Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in. -->

<!-- <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-3.png" -->
<!-- Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.

Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page. -->
